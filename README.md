# hiTRiP

A modified version of the code for [TRiP](https://github.com/KTgreenham/TRiP) [1], a program designed to facilitate the estimation of circadian periods for plant leaf movement data. Modifications have been made to ensure that the program is now more automated and designed for high-thoroughput processes, requiring minimal user interaction, in addition to correcting for human errors that may occur with the previous code. The motion estimation algorithm used remains the same, and the output has been efficiently streamlined to output the raw motion data specifically, which is then fed into another program to provide a more suitable period estimator.
